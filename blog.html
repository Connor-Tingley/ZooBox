				  			Snake Soup <br> 
				  			1. You can cook the soup with any kind of snake, even a poisonous one. The easiest way to deal with the snake is to put it into the deep-freezer for 30-40 minutes prior to cooking. After we take it, frozenly sleeping, out and cut off the head. Be ready that even the headless body will keep on coiling and trying to escape from the table where you fight with it. The separated head will also move its jaws. Here I want to mention about the heart that will keep on beating for half an hour after you have taken it out from the body. In the oriental culture they believe that the heart is the most precious part of the snake. So it is a usual thing to swallow raw, still beating heart together with the wine or rice vodka. The same is done to the gallbladder. It is believed that the regular eating of raw snake hearts and gallbladders cures any disease and prolongs your life. But let’s get back to our recipe. Draw all the inners out of the snake trunk, remove the skin. <br>
					  		2. It is easier to remove the skin if you scald it with the boiling water first. <br>
							3. We wash the meat and snake skin under the running water. Meat will do for the soup and roast, the skin will be used for a tasty crispy snack.<br>
							4. Cut the meat into pieces.<br>
							5. Pour water in the pot with the snake meat and turn on the gas cooker. The snake meat is rather tough by itself. You need to simmer it for 5-6 hours to get the condition of a delicate “chicken-like” meat.<br>
							6. When the meat is ready you can cook soup using the snake broth. But I prefer clean transparent soups, so I take off the ready-cooked meat and pour out the broth. Fill the pot with the clean water, boil it and add vegetables (potato goes first, then add chopped carrots, green beans and the last ones will be corn and sweet pepper).<br>
							7. Add some curry spice, if you like hot spicy dishes you may add some powdered ginger and pepper.<br>
							8. Put the snake meat into the pot with the soup, simmer it on the slow fire for 5-10 more minutes.<br>
							9. The snake soup is done! The snake pieces visually resemble fish, but the taste resembles chicken, just a bit tougher. In spite of long time of cooking the soup, the result appears to be very unusual and tasty.</h1>
